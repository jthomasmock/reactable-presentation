## `reactable` - interactive data tables

`reactable` is an R wrapper for the `react table` javascript library. Greg Lin at RStudio recently made this package and you can install it from CRAN with `install.packages("reactable")`. 

I adapted this table from some examples at the [`reactable` package site](https://glin.github.io/reactable/articles/womens-world-cup/womens-world-cup.html).

If you want to go much deeper than this basic guide, check out the [`reactable` site](https://glin.github.io/reactable/articles/examples.html), which has lots of examples!

## Read in the Data

I've gone through collecting the data and have put into a non-tidy wide format for Salary Rank, playoff week and appearances, Total appearances, and finally salary from 2014-2019.

```{r load libraries and read data}
library(reactable) # for interactive tables
library(tidyverse) # all the things
library(htmltools) # for building div/links
library(paletteer) # for all the palettes

playoff_salary <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jthomasmock/radix_themockup/master/_posts/2020-05-13-qb-salaries-vs-playoff-appearances/playoff_salary.csv")

glimpse(playoff_salary)
```

## Basics of reactable

A very basic `reactable` table can be created as so:

```{r basic reactable}
reactable(playoff_salary)
```

Immediately we have reactive table split into 4x pages with 10 observations per page. 

The core parts we want to change are:  
- Conditional color formatting for Total Appearances and Salary  
- All on one page  
- Change the font  

# Conditional Colors

Like most things in R there are **MANY** ways to generate indeterminate length color palettes. For more info about using color to represent data values check out [Claus Wilke's book section](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/color-basics.html#color-to-represent-data-values). Importantly - we want a sequential/continuous color scale. 


![Figure 4.3](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/color_basics_files/figure-html/sequential-scales-1.png)

Now there are plenty of palettes to choose from, such as `viridis`, `RColorBrewer`, `ggthemes`, as well as a nice meta collection via `paletteer`!

Now it's often hard to keep track of these palettes and what they actually look like.

To display ANY palette or vector of colors in R you can use `scales::show_col()` - `scales` comes along with `ggplot2` & the `tidyverse`, so you probably don't need to install it (just load it)!

```{r load scales and show_col}
library(scales)

scales::show_col(c("red", "black", "blue", "purple"))
```

`scales::show_col()` also works with palettes/vectors.

```{r show_col viridis 1}

viridis::viridis(n = 16)

viridis::viridis(n = 16) %>% 
  scales::show_col()
```

`scales::show_col()` also works with `paletteer` or really any other palette package to display palettes/vectors. You just need to supply > 1 color as a character vector and you're good to go!

```{r show_col red}
"ggsci::red_material" %>% 
  paletteer::paletteer_d(., n = 9) %>% 
  scales::show_col()
```


Now that we understand how to show colors, I'll explain a bit more about our coloring function.

## Color Function

I borrowed my function to generate colors scales through `grDevices::colorRamp()` from Greg Lin's examples. This makes use of `colorRamp` to generate a sequence of colors and then pull them according to a sliding scale normalized to 0-1.

```{r basic palette}
# greg's palette
scales::show_col(c("#ffffff", "#f2fbd2", "#c9ecb4", "#93d3ab", "#35b0ab"))
```

Back to our color scale, we can display an example step-by-step.

```{r color ramp}

# Function by Greg Lin
# Notice bias here = a positive number. 
# Higher values give more widely spaced colors at the high end

make_color_pal <- function(colors, bias = 1) {
  get_color <- colorRamp(colors, bias = bias)
  function(x) rgb(get_color(x), maxColorValue = 255)
}

good_color <- make_color_pal(c("#ffffff", "#f2fbd2", "#c9ecb4", "#93d3ab", "#35b0ab"), bias = 2)

# Generate a vector of example numbers between 0 and 1
seq(0.1, 0.9, length.out = 12)

# create matching colors
good_color(seq(0.1, 0.9, length.out = 12))

# display the colors
seq(0.1, 0.9, length.out = 12) %>% 
  good_color() %>% 
  scales::show_col()
```

The palette that Greg and FiveThirtyEight used for this plot is roughly similar to the lower half of `viridis` - a commonly used continuous color scale that is mostly color-blind friendly.

```{r viridis show_col, echo = FALSE}
viridis::viridis(12, begin = 0.5, direction = -1) %>% 
  scales::show_col()
```


# Format by value

`reactable` has a [section on conditional styling](https://glin.github.io/reactable/articles/conditional-styling.html) - either logical or based on a continuous scale. You can use R or JavaScript functions to change the style of cells.

The core table is seen below with comments added to highlight some emphasized changes.

```{r core table}
playoff_salary %>% 
  mutate(salary = round(salary, 1)) %>% 
    
    ##########################
    ### This section changed
    ##########################
  reactable(
    # ALL one page option (no scrolling or page swapping)
    pagination = FALSE,
    # compact for an overall smaller table width wise
    compact = TRUE,
    # borderless - TRUE or FALSE
    borderless = FALSE,
    # Stripes - TRUE or FALSE
    striped = FALSE,
    # fullWidth - either fit to width or not
    fullWidth = FALSE,
    # apply defaults
    # 100 px and align to center of column
    defaultColDef = colDef(
      align = "center",
      minWidth = 100
    ))
```

To actually change the color according to our color scale, we can use the below code. We are defining an anonymous (unsaved) function and using our `good_color()` function to generate values along our scale.

```{r add scale}
playoff_salary %>% 
  mutate(salary = round(salary, 1)) %>% 
  reactable(
    # ALL one page (no scrolling or page swapping)
    pagination = TRUE,
    # compact for an overall smaller table width wise
    compact = TRUE,
    # borderless - TRUE or FALSE
    borderless = FALSE,
    # Stripes - TRUE or FALSE
    striped = FALSE,
    # fullWidth - either fit to width or not
    fullWidth = FALSE,
    # apply defaults
    # 100 px and align to center of column
    defaultColDef = colDef(
      align = "center",
      minWidth = 100
    ),
    
      ##########################
      ### This section changed
      ##########################
    
    # This part allows us to apply specific things to each column
    columns = list(
      salary = colDef(
        name = "Salary",
        format = colFormat(digits = 1),
        style = function(value) {
          value
          normalized <- (value - min(playoff_salary$salary)) / (max(playoff_salary$salary) - min(playoff_salary$salary))
          color <- good_color(normalized)
          list(background = color)
        }
      )
      )
    )
```

Woo! We now have a color scale ranging from about 4 million to 130 million, but let's indicate Millions with an M so that people don't get confused. There is a bit of JavaScript code here - please note, I don't know JavaScript BUT JavaScript can be a functional programming language, so I bet the code below looks readable to you! In this case, `cellInfo.value` is like `dataframe$value`, so it will parse through and apply the function to each cell in our table.

I adapted this code from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46656851/format-number-into-kthousand-mmillion-in-shiny-datatables).

```{r js fake, eval = FALSE}
"function(cellInfo) { return '$' + cellInfo.value + ' M'}"
```

Formatting numbers all together now, with both the color function and the JS function to add dollar + M to our cells. We can still sort!

```{r format M}
playoff_salary %>% 
  mutate(salary = round(salary, 1)) %>% 
  reactable(
    # ALL one page (no scrolling or page swapping)
    pagination = TRUE,
    # compact for an overall smaller table width wise
    compact = TRUE,
    # borderless - TRUE or FALSE
    borderless = FALSE,
    # Stripes - TRUE or FALSE
    striped = FALSE,
    # fullWidth - either fit to width or not
    fullWidth = FALSE,
    # apply defaults
    # 100 px and align to center of column
    defaultColDef = colDef(
      align = "center",
      minWidth = 100
    ),
    
      ##########################
      ### This section changed
      ##########################
    
    # This part allows us to apply specific things to each column
    columns = list(
      salary = colDef(
        # note I can re-define the name of salary to Salary
        name = "Salary",
        format = colFormat(digits = 1),
        style = function(value) {
          value
          # normalize each value relative to min/max (scale between 0 and 1)
          normalized <- (value - min(playoff_salary$salary)) / (max(playoff_salary$salary) - min(playoff_salary$salary))
          # assign a color base on the normalized value
          color <- good_color(normalized)
          # return a list object of the color
          list(background = color)
        },
        # This is javascript to take the cell's value and add an M to the value
        # Note that because this is done at the JS level
        # the columns still sort properly (they're still numbers!)
        # There are built in format currency options, but not one
        # for compressing to Millions AND to dollars for example
        cell = JS("function(cellInfo) { return '$' + cellInfo.value + ' M'}")
      )
      )
  )
```

## It's still data (just JSON)

```{r}
tbl$x$tag$attribs$data %>% 
  jsonlite::fromJSON() %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  head()
```

```{r}
tbl %>% listviewer::jsonedit()
```

## Format Total Column

Now we can use a similar approach to add color to our Total playoff appearances column. 

```{r all together}
tbl <- playoff_salary %>% 
  mutate(salary = round(salary, 1)) %>% 
  reactable(
    pagination = FALSE,
    compact = TRUE,
    borderless = FALSE,
    striped = FALSE,
    fullWidth = FALSE,
    defaultColDef = colDef(
      align = "center",
      minWidth = 100
    ),
    # Add theme for the top border
    theme = reactableTheme(
      headerStyle = list(
        "&:hover[aria-sort]" = list(background = "hsl(0, 0%, 96%)"),
        "&[aria-sort='ascending'], &[aria-sort='descending']" = list(background = "hsl(0, 0%, 96%)"),
        borderColor = "#555"
      )
    ),
    columns = list(
      salary = colDef(
        name = "Salary",
        format = colFormat(digits = 1),
        align = "right",
        style = function(value) {
          value
          normalized <- (value - min(playoff_salary$salary)) / (max(playoff_salary$salary) - min(playoff_salary$salary))
          color <- good_color(normalized)
          list(background = color)
        },
        cell = JS("function(cellInfo) {return '$' + cellInfo.value + 'M'}")
      ),
      
      ##########################

      # We can now do a similar function for Total to color according to a
      # normalized scale
      Total = colDef(
        style = function(value) {
          value
          normalized <- (value - min(playoff_salary$Total)) / (max(playoff_salary$Total) - min(playoff_salary$Total))
          color <- good_color(normalized)

      player = colDef(
        # Change player to Name
        name = "Name",
        # Widen it so that player names don't get wrapped as much
        minWidth = 140,
        # Align left as it is a wide column
        # this overrides the default above
        align = "left"
      )
    )
  )

tbl
```
